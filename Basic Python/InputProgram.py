name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
# print(f"Your name is {name} and your age is {age}")x, y = input("Enter two numbers separated by space: ").split()
# print(f"First number: {x}, Second number: {y}")

# Why Use f Before a String?
# String Interpolation:

# F-strings make it easy to include variables or expressions directly in a string.
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# Output: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.

# Using f-string
print(f"Result: {5 + 3}")
# Output: Result: 8print(f"Square of 4 is {4**2}")
# Output: Square of 4 is 16name = "Alice"
print("My name is {name}")  # Output: My name is {name}
